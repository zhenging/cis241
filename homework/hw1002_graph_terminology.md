52\. Let **G** be a graph with **v** vertices and **e** edges. Let **M** be the maximum degree of the vertices of **G**, and let **m** be the minimum degree of the vertices of **G**. Show that
a) $2e/v \geq m$ &emsp; b) $2e/v \leq M$.
>Solution
Let the $i$th vertex be $v_i$, and the degree of $v_i$ be $m_i$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
m &\leq m_i\leq M\\
\underbrace{m + m + \cdots + m}_{v \text{ times}} &\leq m_1 + m_2 + \cdots +m_i+ \cdots + m_v \leq \underbrace{M + M + \cdots + M}_{v \text{ times}}\\
vm &\leq \sum_{i\in v}{deg(v_i)} \leq vM\\
vm &\leq 2e \leq vM \quad \text{The handshaking theorem}\\
m &\leq \frac{2e}{v} \leq M \quad \text{a and b are proved.}
\end{aligned}

A simple graph is called regular if every vertex of this graph has the same degree. A regular graph is called **n**-regular if every vertex in this graph has degree **n**.
53\. For which values of **n** are these graphs regular?
a) $K_n$ &emsp; b) $C_n$ &emsp; c) $W_n$ &emsp; d) $Q_n$
>Solution
a. For $n\geq 1$, $K_n$ is a **(n-1)**-regular graph.
b. For $n\geq 3$, $C_n$ is a **2**-regular graph.
c. For $n=3$, $W_n$ is a **3**-regular graph.
d. For $n \geq 0$, $W_n$ is a **n**-regular graph.

54\. For which values of **m** and **n** is **$K_{m,n}$** regular?
>Solution
When $m=n$, $K_{m,n}$ is regular.

In Exercises 21â€“25 determine whether the graph is bipartite. You may find it useful to apply **Theorem 4** and answer the question by determining whether it is possible to assign either red or blue to each vertex so that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color.
