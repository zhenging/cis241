26\. For which values of n do these graphs have an Euler circuit?
a) $K_n$ &emsp; b) $C_n$ &emsp; c) $W_n$ &emsp; d) $Q_n$

28\. For which values of m and n does the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n} have an Euler Path?

In Exercises 30â€“36 determine whether the given graph has a Hamilton circuit. If it does, find such a circuit. If it does not, give an argument to show why no such circuit exists.
