55\. Suppose that a password for a computer system must have at least 8, but no more than 12, characters, where each character in the password is a lowercase English letter, an uppercase English letter, a digit, or one of the six special characters âˆ—, >, <, !, +, and =.
a) How many different passwords are available for this computer system?
>Solution
Let the length of the password be an integer $n \mid 8 \leqslant n \leqslant 12$
There are $26+26+10+6=68$ choices for each character. By product rule, the number of different passwords with length of $n$ is $68^n$. By sum rule, the total number of such passwords is $68^8 + 68^9 + 68^{10} + 68^{11} + 68^{12}$.

b) How many of these passwords contain at least one occurrence of at least one of the six special characters?
>Solution
Let the total number of passwords in part a) be $C_{total}$, the number of password that does not contain any of the six special characters be $C_{nospecial}$, and the number of passwords contain at least one occurence of at least one of the six special characters be $C_{special}$.
1\. By exclusion, $C_{special} = C_{total} - C_{nospecial}$.
2\. According to part a), $C_{total} = 68^8 + 68^9 + 68^{10} + 68^{11} + 68^{12}$. Similarly, $C_{nospecial} = 62^8 + 62^9 + 62^{10} + 62^{11} + 62^{12}$.
3\. $C_{special} = 68^8 + 68^9 + 68^{10} + 68^{11} + 68^{12} - (62^8 + 62^9 + 62^{10} + 62^{11} + 62^{12})$

c) Using your answer to part (a), determine how long it takes a hacker to try every possible password, assuming that it takes one nanosecond for a hacker to check each possible password.
>Solution
The time is $(68^8 + 68^9 + 68^{10} + 68^{11} + 68^{12}) \times 10^{-9}s \approx 314582 \: years$

56\. The name of a variable in the C programming language is a string that can contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, or underscores. Further, the first character in the string must be a letter, either uppercase or lowercase, or an underscore. If the name of a variable is determined by its first eight characters, how many different variables can be named in C? (Note that the name of a variable may contain fewer than eight characters.)
>Solution
Let the length of the variable name be an positive integer $n |0 < n\leqslant 8$.
1\. There are $26+26+1 = 53$ choices for the 1st character, and  there are $26+26+10+1 = 63$ choices for the rest of each character.
2\. By product rule, there are total $53 \times \overbrace{63 \times 63 \cdots \times 63}^{n-1 \: times} = 53 \times 63^{n-1}$ such different variables with length of $n$.
3\. By sum rule, there are total $53 \times 63^{8-1} + 53 \times 63^{7-1} + \cdots \times 53 \times 63^{1-1} = 53(63^7 +63^6+ \cdots + 63^0)$ different variables can be named in C.
