### 8.1 Applications of Recurrence Relations

EXAMPLE 1
**Rabbits and the Fibonacci Numbers** Consider this problem, which was originally posed by Leonardo Pisano, also known as Fibonacci, in the thirteenth century in his book Liber abaci. A young pair of rabbits (one of each sex) is placed on an island. A pair of rabbits does not breed until they are 2 months old. After they are 2 months old, each pair of rabbits produces another pair each month, as shown in Figure 1. Find a recurrence relation for the number of pairs of rabbits on the island after n months, assuming that no rabbits ever die.

EXAMPLE 2
**The Tower of Hanoi** A popular puzzle of the late nineteenth century invented by the French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas, called the Tower of Hanoi, consists of three pegs mounted on a board together with disks of different sizes. Initially these disks are placed on the first peg in order of size, with the largest on the bottom (as shown in Figure 2). The rules of the puzzle allow disks to be moved one at a time from one peg to another as long as a disk is never placed on top of a smaller disk. The goal of the puzzle is to have all the disks on the second peg in order of size, with the largest on the bottom.
Let ${H_n}$ denote the number of moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with $n$ disks. Set up a recurrence relation for the sequence ${H_n}$.
