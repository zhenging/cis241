### 8.2 Solving Linear Recurrence Relations
p535
Ex: 1-6

>Definition
A _linear homogeneous recurrence relation of degree k with constant coefficients_ is a recurrence relation of the form
$$
\begin{aligned}
a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2} + \cdots + c_ka_{n-k},
\end{aligned}
$$
where $c_1, c_2, \cdots c_k$ are real numbers, and $c_k \ne 0$.

+ **Linear** - the right-hand side is a sum of previous terms of the sequence each multiplied by a function of $n$.
+ **Homogeneous** - no terms occur that are not multiplies of $a_j$s.
+ **Constants** - the coefficients of the terms are constants
+ **Degree** - $a_n$ is expressed in terms of the previous $k$ terms of the sequence.

Example 1
The recurrence relation $P_n = (1.11)P_{n-1}$ is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation of degree _one_. The recurrence relation $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation of degree _two_. The recurrence relation $a n = a_{n-5}$ is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation of degree _five_.

Example 2
The recurrence relation $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ is not linear. The recurrence relation $H_n = 2H_{n-1} + 1$ is not homogeneous. The recurrence relation $B_n = nB_{n-1}$ does not have constant
coefficients.
